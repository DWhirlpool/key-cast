# Tech Stack

Made with Pyton's Tkinter

# Note

Right now it is heavily under development, and is being developed in linux (ubuntu), can break if you try, because i am working on it to make compatible with all kind of keyboards (because sometimes key codes differ for same key combinations on different OS/PC)
